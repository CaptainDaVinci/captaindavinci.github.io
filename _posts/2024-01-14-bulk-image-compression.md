# Bulk Image Compression Service

A project born out of the desire to provide a straightforward and free solution for compressing images in bulk. This service supports a variety of image formats, including JPG, JPEG, and PNG, and it's all available to you at no cost. Let's dive into the details. 

### Why?

There are plenty of existing compression services out there, but they are usually filled with advertisements or behind a paywall. Moreover, they require uploading the data onto a remote
server, this isn't ideal.

#### Key Features:
- **Bulk Compression:** Compress multiple images simultaneously, saving you time and effort.
- **Format Support:** Works seamlessly with JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats, ensuring versatility for your image compression needs.
- **Local processing:** Data never leaves your device.
- **Free forever, no ads!**

### Localized Data Processing:
Concerned about privacy? Fret not. With this service, all data processing happens locally on your machine. No uploads, no sign-ups. Just a simple, efficient, and secure way to compress your images. 
Under the hood, it uses MozJPEG encoding for compression of JPEG and JPG formats. What sets MozJPEG apart is its efficiency in preserving image quality while reducing file sizes. Unlike browser-specific encoding, MozJPEG offers a more sophisticated and superior compression algorithm. It also uses OxiPNG for supporting lossless PNG compression.

Codecs for MozJPEG adn OxiPNG are enabled using Webassembly.

### Next Steps: Expanding File Support

Will look at adding support for other file formats for compression.
