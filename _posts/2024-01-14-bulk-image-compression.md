# Introducing My Bulk Image Compression Service

A project born out of the desire to provide a straightforward and free solution for compressing images in bulk. This service supports a variety of image formats, including JPG, JPEG, and PNG, and it's all available to you at no cost. Let's dive into the details. 

### Why?

There are plenty of existing compression services out there, but they are usually filled with advertisements or behind a paywall. Moreover, they require uploading the data onto a remote
server, this isn't ideal.

#### Key Features:
- **Bulk Compression:** Compress multiple images simultaneously, saving you time and effort.
- **Format Support:** Works seamlessly with JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats, ensuring versatility for your image compression needs.
- **Free to Use!** 

### Localized Data Processing:
Concerned about privacy? Fret not. With this service, all data processing happens locally on your machine. No uploads, no sign-ups. Just a simple, efficient, and secure way to compress your images.

## Implementation Details

### MozJPEG Encoding:
Under the hood, my service utilizes MozJPEG encoding for compression. What sets MozJPEG apart is its efficiency in preserving image quality while reducing file sizes. Unlike browser-specific encoding, MozJPEG offers a more sophisticated and superior compression algorithm.

### WebAssembly (WASM) Magic:
To enable MozJPEG encoding directly in your browser, I leverage WebAssembly (Wasm). This allows me to bring the power of MozJPEG to your local environment, enhancing the compression process without compromising speed or security.

### Next.js Framework for Frontend Development:
The frontend of my Bulk Image Compression Service is built using the Next.js framework. This choice was deliberate, as Next.js provides a seamless development experience, allowing me to create a responsive and user-friendly interface for my service.

## Next Steps: Expanding File Support

While the Bulk Image Compression Service currently excels in handling images, I'm not stopping here. The next steps involve expanding the service to support compression for additional file types, such as PDFs, DOCX, and more. Stay tuned for updates as I work towards making this service an all-encompassing solution for your file compression needs.
